A review of personality and performance: Identifying boundaries,
contingencies, and future research directions states: "Although motivation has been defined in many ways, the most commonly cited theories focus on the cognitive processes underlying goal-setting, defined as the “arousal, direction, intensity and persistence of voluntary actions that are goal directed” (Mitchell, 1997, p. 60)."

From https://ipip.ori.org/InterpretingIndividualIPIPScaleScores.htm:
"An alternative method for showing respondents where they stand with respect to a group of respondents is to divide a set of scores into five equal parts, which are called quintiles. Labels for the scale anchors describe the lowest 20% and highest 20%, the label "average" is used for the middle 20%, and the remaining quintiles are labeled "somewhat." For example, labels for the quintiles on a scale that ranges from introversion to extraversion would be introverted, somewhat introverted, average, somewhat extraverted, and extraverted."

" Five Factor Model (FFM), is that Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness to Experience are the five basic factors that underlie personality" is different than Big Five Factors

"Furthermore, some
researchers have found that managers implicitly use personality factors in their hiring
decisions (Dunn et al., 1995) and it is therefore prudent to conduct studies which
investigate potential relationships between personality and performance so that managers
may be given some guidance in the use (or potential misuse) of personality a:~ a
selection measure."

self-managed work teams. 

However, the preliminary results from the studies in existence indicate that some personality traits may affect
performance for certain tasks in certain situations (Driskell et al., 1987)

## Conscientiousness
This extension of logic is also supported by recent findings by Thorns et al. (1996) which show that
**'Conscientiousness' is positively related to self-efficacy** (which the authors contend is
predictive of performance) for participation in self-managed work groups.

Groups whose members showed a high need for **achievement** outperformed groups
whose members had a low need for achievement (French, 1958; Schneider and Delaney,
1972; Zander and Forward, 1968) on a variety of tasks. **Leadership orientation** was also
found to correlate positively with group performance (Shaw and Harkey, 1976). In
addition to this, Driskell et al. (1987) proposed that **'ambition'** (which includes 'need for
achievement') may be predictive of team performance for a variety of tasks.

Conscientiousness key words: ```Self-efficacy, achievement, ambition```  

__Hypothesis 1:__ The team's level of Conscientiousness (operationally defined as the
sum of the scores received by each individual on the factor of Conscientiousness) will
be positively related to the performance of the team.

## Extraversion

'Extraversion' is exemplified by such traits as **sociability, gregariousness, assertiveness, talkativeness, and activeness** (Barrick and Mount, 1991; Digman, 1990). 'Extraversion' has been shown to have positive
validity in predicting future individual job performance for those occupations that have a
large social component

**Dominance**, (which is closely related to the factor of **'Ambition'**; Hogan, 1991),
which in turn loads on the factor of 'Extraversion' (Hough, 1992) has been shown to be
positively related to the performance of the group (Haythorn, 1953; Ghiselli and Lodahl,
1958; Smelser, 1961; Altman and Haythorn, 1967; Bouchard, 1969; Shaw and Harkey,
1976; Driskell et al., 1987; Williams and Sternberg, 1988) as well as the degree of
participation within the group (Mann, 1959; Watson, 1971).

The level of **'Sociability'** (which is part of 'Extraversion', according to Hogan, 1991)
of group members has been shown to relate positively to team performance (Bouchard,
1969; Shaw, 1971). ...studies relating personality factors to
team characteristics by Mann (1959) reported a positive relationship between the factor
of 'Extroversion' (which consisted of 'Sociability' and 'Surgency') and the degree of
group member task-related participation.

The degree of participation within the group is usually operationalized as the amaount
of talking done by each group member. (Ah, communication!) Williams and Sternberg (1988) found that both
the average amount of talking done by members of the group and the maximum amount
of talking done by any member of the group was positively correlated with the
performance of the group.

Most of the evidence seems to suggest that there should be a positive relationship
between the factor of 'Extraversion' and team performance.

__Hypothesis 2:__ The team's level of Extraversion (operationally defined as the sum of
the scores received by each individual on the factor of Extraversion) will be positively
related to the performance of the team.

Extraversion key words: ```social, talkative, dominance, ambition, assertive, active```  

## Neuroticism

The factor of 'Neuroticism' may also be thought of as a lack of 'Emotional Stability',
or 'Adjustment' (which is the degree to which one exhibits 'Emotional Stability').
'Neuroticism' is characterized by traits such as **anxiety, depression, anger, embarrassment, emotionality, and insecurity** (Digman, 1990; Barrick and Mount, 1991).

In sum, the consensus seems to be that 'Emotional Stability' should be positively correlated with
subsequent group performance, or, that 'Neuroticism' should be negatively correlated
with subsequent group performance.

__Hypothesis 3:__ The team's level of Neuroticism (operationally defined as the sum of
the scores received by each individual on the team on the factor of Neuroticism) will be
negatively related to the team's performance.

Neuroticism key words: ```anxiety, depression, anger, embarrassment, emotionality, insecurity```  

## Agreeableness
A person exhibiting traits included in the 'Agreeableness' (or likability) factor is **courteous,**
**flexible, trusting, good natured, cooperative, forgiving, soft-hearted, and tolerant.**

The results linking 'Likability' with group performance are not consistent across studies.

Given the intellectual nature of the optimizing task, it is not known
if the factor of 'Agreeableness' will be related to team performance and thus no
hypotheses are proposed

__Hypothesis X:__ **MORE RESEARCH NEEDED** 

Agreeableness key words: ```courteous, flexible, trusting, good natured, cooperative, forgiving, soft-hearted, tolerant```  

## Openness to experience (or 'Intellect')

Traits associated with this factor include **imagination, culture, curiosity, originality, broad-mindedness, intelligence, and 'artisticness'** (Barrick and Mount, 1991).

The personnel selection literature proposes that the factor 'Openness to Experience'
is predictive of a person's training proficiency (Barrick and Mount, 1991), however, it
was not found to be predictive of job performance.

Agreeableness key words: ```imagination, culture, curiosity, originality, broad-mindedness, intelligence, and 'artisticness'```

### Other
A few studies have looked at the interaction of team member personalities in
relation to team performance. Teams (tetrads) composed of members with heterogeneous
personality profiles outperformed those with members who had homogeneous personalities 
on several optimizing tasks (Hoffman, 1958; Hoffman and Maier, 1961).
In the alternative, heterogeneity of individual characteristics offers breeding grounds
for interpersonal conflict detrimental to team performance (Hoffman and Maier, 1961).
Similarity theory argues that homogeneity of
group members is desirable since it evokes positive forms of mutual attraction while
heterogeneity introduces divisive tensions (Tziner, 1985). 
**That is, heterogeneity on some factors may be beneficial to team performance (e.g., to promote creativity), while homogeneity on other factors may he necessary to ensure team harmony and productivity (Belbin, 1981).**

Hypothesis 4: The personality of the team members will provide incremental validity
over that provided by general cognitive ability in the prediction of team performance.
Since personality is not thought to covary with general cognitive ability
(Barrick and Mount, 1991), personality has the potential to make a unique contribution
of information to the selection process. 

(Basically, personality adds a dimension to choosing a team where the general cognitive
ability is the first/primary dimension)

__Hypothesis 4:__ The personality of the team members will provide incremental validity
over that provided by general cognitive ability in the prediction of team performance.

Many authors have claimed that groups need to be large
enough to accomplish the work assigned to them, but when too large, groups may be
dysfunctional due to heightened coordination rules (Steiner, 1972; O'Reilly and Roberts,
1977; Gladstein, 1984; Campion et al., 1993)

Team member personality was measured using the NEO-Five Factor Inventory (or
'NEO-FFI' which is a shortened version of the NEO-Personality Inventory, or 'NEO-PI')
personality test (Costa and McCrae, 1992). **The NEO-PI has been recommended by Hogan (1991) as a good measure of the Big Five personality dimensions.**

The NEO-PI has reported alpha coefficients
across the facets measured ranging from 0.61 to 0.79 for men and 0.60 to 0.82 for
women (Hess, 1992). 

General cognitive ability was measured using Form IV of the Wonderlic Personnel
Test. This short (t2 rain) test of general cognitive ability includes items in vocabulary,
'commonsense' reasoning, formal syllogisms, arithmetic reasoning and computation,
analogies, perceptual skill, spatial relations, numerical series, scrambled sentences, and
knowledge of proverbs. 

From Science Direct: "Cognitive ability is defined as a general mental capability involving reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, complex idea comprehension, and learning from experience (Gottfredson, 1997)."


From: Procrastination

"Increased procrastination is mainly associated with decreased conscientiousness... 
Neuroticism has an intermittent relationship with procrastination, depending on the measure, which disappears once conscientiousness is controlled for"

":However, from a selection standpoint, only general
cognitive ability and Neuroticism provided unique variance in differentiating successful
from unsuccessful teams. The heterogeneity of Conscientiousness was negatively related
to the performance of successful teams"
