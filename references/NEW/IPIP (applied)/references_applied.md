# Key Takeaways:
[1]  Culture may affect trait correlations: "It is intriguing that some of the five
personality dimensions are negatively correlated in the Korean TIPI, as they all tend to be
positively correlated—perhaps due to social desirability—in the Western cultures. These
negative correlations may be explained by cultural differences: Leung and Bozionelos
(2004) report that in the Confucian tradition, both Extraversion and Openness are likely to
be viewed negatively, while Agreeableness and Emotional Stability tend to be viewed
positively. As a consequence, people are more likely to disapprove of politicians who are
out-going and embrace new, unconventional ideas." 

[2] Compared to task performance, contextual performance is particularly
important in team settings. Task performance reflects activities that are
formally recognized as part of the job, support the organization’s technical core, and directly impact organizational goal accomplishment. This
has been the focus in traditional, individually oriented selection systems.
Contextual performance reflects activities that support the organizational,
social, and psychological environment (Borman & Motowidlo, 1993),
thereby facilitating effective team functioning. For example, the interpersonal helping, job dedication, and initiative reflective of contextual
performance helps make teams work in organizational settings. Without
this kind of contextual performance, the development and maintenance of
teams will not be successful.
* Hypothesis 2: Conscientiousness will be positively related to contextual
performance in team settings.
* Hypothesis 3: Extraversion will be positively related to contextual performance in team settings.
* Hypothesis 4: Agreeableness will be positively related to contextual performance in team settings.
* Hypothesis 5: Emotional Stability (low Neuroticism) will be positively related to contextual
performance in team settings.
