# Key Takeaways 
[2] We investigated the top five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for each trait, and revealed the most highly association with neuroticism and TACC2 (rs1010657, P = 8.79 × 10− 7), extraversion and PTPN12 (rs12537271, P = 1.47 × 10− 7), openness and IMPAD1 (rs16921695,
P = 5 × 10− 8), agreeableness and RPS29 (rs8015351, P = 1.27 × 10− 6) and conscientiousness and LMO4 (rs912765,
P = 2.91 × 10− 6). It had no SNP reached the GWA study threshold (Po5 × 10− 8). When expanded the SNPs up to top 100,
the correlation of PTPRD (rs1029089) and agreeableness was confirmed in Healthy Twin cohort with other 13 SNPs. This GWA
meta-analysis on FFM personality traits is meaningful as it was the first on a non-Caucasian population targeted to FFM of
personality traits.

[3] In particular, DRD1 and ORIA2 were linked to Neuroticism, NKAIN2 with Extraversion, HTR5A with Openness and DRD3 with Agreeableness. Data from our replication study of 2090 subjects confirmed the association between ORIA2 and Neuroticism. We first identified and
confirmed a novel region on ORIA2 associated with Neuroticism. Candidate genes for psychiatric disorders were also enriched.
These findings contribute to our understanding of the genetic architecture of personality traits and provide critical clues to the
neurobiological mechanisms that influence them.
